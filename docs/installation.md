# Setting Up the Project
## Option 1: Using a Local Web Server
To view the website locally, you can use a local web server.

1. **Open the project in your code editor.**
2. **Open the index.html file in your web browser:**
a) If you are using VSCode, you can use the "Live Server" extension to serve the site locally.
b) Alternatively, you can open the index.html file directly in your browser, but this might not support all features (like AJAX requests).

## Option 2: Using Node.js (Optional)
If you prefer using Node.js and npm, you can set up a simple web server using packages like "http-server".

1. **Install http-server globally:**

    ```sh
    npm install -g http-server

2. **Start the server:**

    ```sh
    http-server

3. **Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080.**
